# datamodel-aml-java
This repository provides to convert edge data to industrial standard data based on AutomationML and vice versa.
Export microservice can stream its data to external system such as northbound edges and cloud.
Using the industrial data model, each system communicates its data without effort to define new data format between each.

AutomationML is the most comprehensive data format of plant engineering. It is already used in the field and is also available in several products. Within IEC 62714 all parts of AutomationML are going to be standardised internationally.
